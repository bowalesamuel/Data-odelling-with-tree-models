# Data-Modelling-with-tree-models

## Introduction

In this workbook, we looked at the Decision tree and Random forest models. Before that, we had to prepare and clean the dataset for modelling. 
### Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values
- Column selection
- Normalization: scaling the numerical columns with standardscaler and the categorical columns with label encoder

### Modelling with Decision tree
- 10 fold cross validation analysis
- Training and testing with the same set of data points (overfitting)
- Training and testing with different datasets 
- Altering Minimal number of instances permissible per leaf.
- Changing the Splitting criteria
- Altering Max depth of the tree
- Training and testing set variation
